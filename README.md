# Python-Network-Tools

This tool is intended to be a modularized set of scripts to perform network functions in Python3.
I found myself having to repeatedly look up how to perform certain Python functions related to networking
so I put them in one place as a reference and functional tool

Note: Tools inside of the scripts folder are stand alone scripts

### Required libs:

* dnspython

### Install:

To install dependencies manually:

```pip3 install dnspython3```

To install with script:

```bash install/install.sh```

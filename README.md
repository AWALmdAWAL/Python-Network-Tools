# Python-Network-Tools

This tool is intended to be a modularized set of scripts to perform network functions in Python.
I found myself having to repeatedly look up how to perform certain python functions related to networking
so I put them in one place as a reference and functional tool

Note: Tools inside of the scripts folder are stand alone scripts

### Required libs:

* PycURL
* dnspython

### Install:

To install dependencies manually:

```pip install pycurl```

```pip install dnspython```

To install with script:

```bash install.sh```
